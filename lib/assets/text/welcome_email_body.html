<p>Navigating government just got easier with MyGov.</p>
<p/>
<p>We've been busy reimagining the relationship between the government and the people. Rather than organizing services around the agencies that deliver them (as it is today) and forcing the public to absorb the complexity of bureaucracy, MyGov organizes services around people and the specific tasks they complete at all levels of government.</p>
<p/>
<p>In a nutshell, we want to help you save time, stay informed, and get connected to the government services and content that matter most to you.</p>
<p/>
<p>With MyGov, we've created a place where, among other things, agencies can publish apps to communicate with you (via notifications). Rest assured, though, you are in control. You authorize who can send you messages, how you receive them, and when. Here in the Notification center, you'll be able to:</p>
<p/>
<ol>
  <li>View notifications from agencies you've authorized.</li>
  <li>Tell us how you'd like to receive them: email, text, or carrier pigeon.</li>
  <li>Opt out if you no longer wish to receive them at all.</li>
</ol
<p/>
<p>(Truth be told, we're having a little trouble training the pigeons to type on a keyboard.)</p>
<p/>
